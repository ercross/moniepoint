Here lies the source code for the design implementation of all pages of a sample real-estate mobile app found at [source](https://dribbble.com/shots/23780608-Real-Estate-App). All scroll behaviors, effects and animations as imitated as time permitted.

# Compilation and Installation
[Here](https://dribbble.com/shots/23780608-Real-Estate-App) is an official Flutter documentation guide on how to compile this app and install on your Android device

# Limitations
- Test instruction hinted that applicants should focus on producing a close imitation or [Photocopy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlVfVVpk-0) of the app, as showcased in the video at [source](https://dribbble.com/shots/23780608-Real-Estate-App). Hence, this is not a fully featured app, as feature implementation was not the objective of this test.
- Though Flutter can build for many other platforms, this implementation builds only for Android release
- Due to time constraints, the app may not be fully optimized and may not be suitable for production use-case. If I were asked to build for production, I'd profile resource (cpu and memory) usage to spot bottlenecks and memory leaks
